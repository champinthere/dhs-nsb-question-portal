# Question Submission

## Fundamental Guidelines

### What should a question look like?

#### General

We recommend reading the [Science Bowl Rules](http://science.energy.gov/~/media/wdts/nsb/pdf/coordinator%20resources/2015_nsb_rules.pdf) to get a general idea of what a question looks like as well as an understanding of the competition in general. You can also watch previous Science Bowl Finals [(last years final)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA6Lhv3FcSU) on YouTube to see the competition in action.

#### Basics

Essentially, questions come in pairs of **toss-ups** and **bonuses**, which fall in one of 6 subjects:

* Biology
* Chemistry
* Physics
* Math
* Earth/Space Science
* Energy

Each toss-up has a five-second time limit (meaning a five second time limit after the question is fully read) while each bonus has a 10-second time limit. Both teams have the opportunity to answer the toss-up: if a team gets it right, that team (and only that team) has the opportunity to answer the corresponding bonus. The toss-up is worth 4 points while the bonus is worth 10.

### Question Styles
Really you can only absorb the specific format of the questions by reading some yourself: see [here](http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/high-school/high-school-regionals/hs-rules-forms-resources/sample-science-bowl-questions/).

Essentially there are two types of questions: free response and multiple choice. Science bowl questions are rarely—if ever—worded in complete the sentence format. Generally, they are phrased as a proper question or, for free response, phrased in command form: "name (something) that satisfies (something else)."

#### Multiple Choice

Multiple choice questions all consist of a question body and 4 answer choices: W, X, Y, and Z.  Try to keep answer choices relatively short (**at least** under a sentence). Similar answer choices should be parallel in structure: for example, for the question

> Which of the following operations on angular velocity and the circular radius equates to the tangential velocity along a circle at that radius?

the answer choices should be:

> * Angular velocity plus the radius
> * Angular velocity minus the radius
> * Angular velocity times the radius
> * Angular velocity divided by the radius

and not:

> * Angular velocity plus the radius
> * The angular velocity minus the radius
> * Radius times the angular velocity
> * The quotient of the angular velocity and the radius

#### Free Response

Free response questions consist of a question body with a open-ended answer. Answers to free response questions should be no longer than a short phrase and should be unambiguous. If multiple answers are acceptable (should only occur if an answer can be worded multiple ways) then alternate answers should be listed in brackets. 

## Specific Instructions
When submitting (bi-)weekly sets, please create a new question set for each meeting. Please title the set "Weekly Set [due date- mm/dd/yy]."

For example, if you are submitting your weekly set for the September 10th 2015 meeting, title your set "Weekly Set 09/10/15." You don't have to include your name in the title, as long as you filled in your name correctly when signing up. 

If you signed up using an alias or didn't include both your First and Last name when signing up, please contact us immediately at dullessciencebowl@gmail; otherwise, we will not be able to give you credit for your questions.

Each question set should consist of five or more questions. Try to have one Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Math question, with the last question either Earth/Space Science or Energy. You should randomize the order subjects appear in your question set.
